## TODO:

- [ ] storage: I'll go with schemaless
  - ??? maybe ask for the events to the server

- [X] media: `youtube-player` is back. No way to work with `lite-youtube`
- [X] papers: order by create
- [X] scores: basic service
- [X] resources: only modules are accessible after done
- [X] lit: consider avoid using lit. angular signal just have improved a lot
- [ ] live: I think when DELETE it's returning the object or is the blob
- [X] youtube: change `@angular/youtube-player` for `@justinribeiro/lite-youtube`
  - [ ] styles: revisar bien, algo se podr√° hacer...
- [X] scores: change records for scores
